**1. The games all involve a full deck of cards. Diffrent functions are used. However, some of the functions overlap but have different implementations between the games. 

**2. The instance variable is initialized in the Board class. Inside constructor of ElevensBoard, the values are passed into the constructor of the superclass.

**3. They cover all the differences because all of the methods are exactly the same between the card games. They are implemented in the Board class while the overlapping functions are abstract, and implemented in the subclasses.
